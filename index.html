Dear friend,

  </p>
      <p>
In Colombia we don't celebrate <i>Valentine's day</i> but the <i>DÃ­a de Amor y Amistad</i> (Day of Love and Friendship) day and it is around the corner.  It celebrated the third Saturday of September every year. This is a traditional celebration in Colombia which goes beyond romantic relationships, but we all show our love and affection to everybody around us. One of the most important traditions is to play <i>Amigo secreto</i> (Secret friend, the same as Secret Santa as you might have figured out), where we give a simple but meaninful present to a person in a gathering with food & drinks.  We would like to do such a nice activity this year with you all most likely at the end of September, so please, let us know if you want/can participate and we'll organize the rest.

  </p>
      <p>
Diego & Mao
